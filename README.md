## What did I learn
I further developed my knowledge of localStorage abilities while implementing a new understanding of jQuery, Bootstrap and Dayjs to create a dynamic application.
<br>
This application tested my understanding of Third Party API's in particular Dayjs to access the current time and date and jQuery which provides a simplified alternative to standard javaScript.
